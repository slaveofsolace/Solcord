# Security policy

## Report a vulnerability privately

Use [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/slaveofsolace/Solcord/security/advisories/new). GitHub private vulnerability reporting is enabled for this repository. You will need to sign in to submit a report.

Include the affected Solcord version or commit, the component, reproduction steps, and the potential impact. Use a minimal fixture with invented data. Never include Discord tokens, real private messages, account identifiers, private databases, or raw crash logs.

Keep exploit details out of public issues until the report has been reviewed and a disclosure plan agreed. For ordinary bugs, use the [bug report form](https://github.com/slaveofsolace/Solcord/issues/new?template=BUG-REPORT.yml) and follow the [screenshot and diagnostics guidance](SUPPORT.md#report-a-bug).

## Supported source

Reports should identify the published release or exact `development` commit they affect. Development builds and unreleased candidates are not stable releases; an installer or artifact is supported only under its recorded version and limitations.

The [privacy guide](docs/SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md) explains local data and network behavior. The [security architecture](docs/development/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md) describes the trust boundaries and implementation safeguards.
